      // Problem Statement:
      // You're given an array heights, where heights[i] represents the height of the i-th bar. You need to find two bars such that, when forming a container between them, the container can hold the maximum amount of water. The width of the container is the distance between the two selected bars along the x-axis, and the height of the container is the minimum of the two bars' heights.

        if (heights.length <= 2) return maxArea; //there must be three blocks to trap the rain water
        let left = 0;
        let right = heights.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
          const width = right - left;
          const minHeight = Math.min(heights[left], heights[right]);
          const area = width * minHeight;
          maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);

          if (heights[left] < heights[right]) {
            left++;
          } else {
            right--;
          }
        }

        return maxArea;
      }

      // Example usage:
      const heights = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 6, 2, 3, 0];
      console.log(
        "Maximum amount of water that can be held:",
